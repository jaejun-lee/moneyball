# Will More Spending money guarantee winning in Premier League Soccer League.



# Background
----------
Since Machester City, a English Premier League team, had been bought by Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, in 2008, the team spent over Â£1.4 billion in player transfer (https://www.verdict.co.uk/manchester-city-trophies-sheikh-mansour/) and achieved 7 trophies including 3 premier league title. I got interested how strongly the player salary affects teams performance in winning, goals, clean sheet and etc.
